# Active Context: Payment Dashboard (PayNest)

## Current State

**Project Status**: ✅ In Progress - Backend reliability foundation hardened, frontend upgraded from an overview shell into a broader multi-view operational dashboard, the documentation/deployment surface now better explains the live demo contract, routing expectations, and honest support posture, and the local validation contract is less Bun-coupled so normal installed tooling can execute quality gates more predictably

A NestJS payment orchestration backend with 15+ gateway integrations, now paired with a significantly stronger static dashboard surface that frames the product as a payment orchestration and webhook reliability platform. The current hosted experience now emphasizes overview KPIs, trust/reliability cues, gateway portfolio coverage, refund operations posture, and analytics storytelling while remaining compatible with the existing static-serving approach.

- [x] Added non-mutating quality-gate scripts for lint, type-check, and build verification
- [x] Added first automated tests around webhook invalid-signature handling, duplicate suppression, replay guardrails, backlog-aware health responses, security-smoke header enforcement, and refund lifecycle orchestration
- [x] Expanded the hosted dashboard into a stronger multi-view control surface with Transactions, Webhooks, and Reliability views driven by existing API state

- [x] Added lightweight regression coverage for the hosted dashboard shell structure and required API wiring
- [x] Added filterable webhook inbox feed APIs with aggregate summary metadata for dashboard-ready operational views
- [x] Added a detail endpoint for stored webhook events so the inbox can evolve toward drill-in UX without reworking webhook architecture
- [x] Enriched health telemetry with a reliability summary covering replay visibility, blocked replay posture, retry exhaustion, recent 24-hour activity, and latest webhook timestamps
- [x] Extended e2e, regression, and unit validation around webhook feed contracts and richer health reliability payloads
- [x] Wired the hosted dashboard webhook view to server-side feed filters, API-backed summary cards, and detail hydration from stored webhook event records

- [x] Refined `SPEC.md` with the seven-view dashboard architecture, startup fetch contract, route expectations, and more explicit support-posture guidance
- [x] Reworked `DEPLOYMENT.md` around a single-service live demo story, required API dependencies, `/api/v1` routing caveat, and honest reviewer verification steps
- [x] Tightened dashboard-facing connection copy and regression coverage to better communicate required live endpoints during portfolio walkthroughs
- [x] Normalized validation scripts so `build`, `build-check`, and `type-check` invoke installed Nest/TypeScript CLIs directly instead of Bun wrappers
- [x] Expanded flat ESLint coverage to include `test/**/*.ts` and `jest.config.ts` so local linting matches the intended validation surface
- [x] Fixed Stripe webhook transaction reconciliation to use the verified payload shape returned by the Stripe gateway
- [x] Replaced wildcard credentialed CORS with an explicit/configurable origin allowlist in the shared app factory
- [x] Fixed the refunds entity nullability typing so Render/TypeScript builds stop inferring array overloads during refund creation
- [x] Reworked the hosted root experience into a professional landing page with a demo login handoff before entering the live dashboard
- [x] Aligned the static dashboard startup fetch paths with the currently mounted NestJS controller routes for same-origin Render deployment
- [x] Added explicit `uuid` column typing to audit log foreign-key reference fields so Render/PostgreSQL no longer rejects `AuditLog` metadata during bootstrap
- [x] Added explicit `varchar` typing to audit log status-history columns so Render/PostgreSQL no longer infers `Object` for nullable audit statuses
- [x] Added explicit `varchar` typing to nullable webhook and payment string columns so Render/PostgreSQL no longer infers unsupported `Object` metadata during TypeORM bootstrap
- [x] Tightened Jest config and test helpers so type-check and targeted unit/integration validation pass cleanly after the Postgres metadata hardening
